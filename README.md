The admin will be able to login and perform all the CRUD operations to the database.
Google's Firebase has been used as a backend service. Firebase can sync data in milliseconds. With fully Firebase-powered apps, user authentication can be handled by a simple login service which supports Facebook, Twitter, Github and Google; in addition to a regular email/password login scheme. Simple Login eliminates the need for you to write your own server-side authentication code.
